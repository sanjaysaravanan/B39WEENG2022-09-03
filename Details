Topics:
  Anonymous Function ---> A function without any name
  IIFE --> Immediately Invoked Function Expression & 

  Plural --> Multiple Items or More than One
  Array Methods: 
    callback function accepts parameters (value, index, array)
    value --> element of array on each iteration
    index --> index of the elemen on each iteration
    array --> Complate array on top of which the forEach is called

    Filter --> Takes a function which returns true or false condition 
      based on which the elements of the array will accumulated into a new array
    Find --> Takes a function which returns true or false condition
      based on which return the first element of the array which satifies the condition
    FindIndex --> Takes a function which returns true or false condition
      based on which return the index of the first element of the array which satifies the condition

    forEach
      1. simply iterates and executes the passed function
      2. No Return type

    Map --> 
      1. iterates and accumulated the return of the passed function into a new Array. if no return in the function then undefined will be accumulated as new array
      2. Return an array same length

    Join:
      Join the elements of the array with a pattern in-between

    Push:
      insert an element at the end/next available index of the array
      
    Pop:
      Removes the last element of the array returns the removed item
      
    Reverse:
      Reverses the entire array of elements


    Flat:
      return the new array whose array elements are flattend
    
    Flatmap:
      returns a new array whose array elements are flatted with map at a depth of 1
